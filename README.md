# TwitterSTREAMS
I was interested in [MarkLogic](http://jp.marklogic.com/) in the way that it is buzzing around the internet on behalf of **"The only enterprise NoSQL database"**. This application is a sample App to understand MarkLogic more deeply.

##What is TwitterSTREAMS?
Since I wanted to make something that has both "real-time" and "big-data" aspects, I decided to use the Twitter Streaming API. This app retrieves realtime twitter streams using the Twitter Streaming API and insert it into MarkLogic8(Hosted on AWS). Provides a front-end app to analyze the quantity of the stream coming in from Twitter. It also provides a real-time search function.
